{"name":"Chad's Laserdisc Software Decoder Page","tagline":"","body":"Required parts for setup:\r\n\r\n- Laserdisc player, preferably with an easily accessable row of test points - all later Pioneers have that.  I currently use the CLD-V2800, but have used an LD-V8000 with soldered on leads in the past.\r\n\r\n- Linux box with a PCI slot, preferably with a lot of CPU power and a few hundred GB of space.  I use an i7 2600 personally, and encoding currently is at 5% real time.  (But ideally that only needs to be done once per disk...)\r\n\r\n- PCI capture card with an CX23880 chip, running my cxadc-linux3 driver.  Other SDR capture systems that can do 8fsc (28.6mhz) should also work, and the code can be adapted to work with other capture rates, ~25-26mhz minimum.\r\n\r\n- Highly recommended:  signal amplifier.  VGA amplifiers with adjustable gain such as the Ocean Matrix/Kramer OMX-4000 are suitable.  There's another one that gives me 1-2 more Db, but I was unable to obtain another one.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
